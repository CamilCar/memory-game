# Memory game with famous buildings! 

This is a game created to help improve memory or reduce boredom! The board consist of 12 cards, and you must find each matching card to win the round.
## Features
---------------------
### Existing Features
- Header 
    - At the top of the page, you find the game name: Memory Game with famous buildings! The background and font is visually pleasing and invites user to a round. The name is clear for the user for what kind of game this is.  

- The instructions
    - To the right, underneath the header, there is a short instruction telling the player to start the game by flipping a card. Easy!  

- The player score
    - To the left, there is a counter that tracks how many rounds user has completed. Each completed round gives +1 to player score.  

- The game: options
    - The game displays text under the title, that user clicks a card to start the game, and that user has to find the matching card.  
    - When two unmatching cards has been flipped, the cards are turned face down again after 1 second. When two matching cards have been found, they stay turned facing upwards until the round is over.  

- The game: results
    - When user has found all matching cards, the round is over. A point will be added to players score.  

- Features left to implement
    - If there would have been time, i would have liked to create a footer where user can learn more about each building. If user were to click on a building name in the footer, the link(opens in new tab) would have brought them to the wikipedia page for that building. Learning through games is a fun and strong combination. 
    - I would have added a favorite icon, for design and for users to easier navigate to the game. 
    - Added a 'attempt' counter, showing the user how many cards have been turned in each round. To challenge the user to complete the board with less turning of the cards, and therefore show the user that the memory training is working!

    ## Testing 
    ------------
- I have tested this in following browsers : Chrome, Firefox.  

- I have confirmed that the game results will always be correct.  

- I can confirm that the header, options, instructions, footer and results are all readable, and if css fail to load, vital content will still be visable to user.  

- I have tested with devtool Lighthouse that all colors and fonts are easy to read.
